    - `git clone https://github.com/GNVageesh/Bilobe.git` <br>
    - `bash install.sh`<br>

2. Windows OS

    - `bash update.sh`

    > **_This will pull the code from the repo and rebuild Bilobe with the new version._**

2. Windows OS

## Advice for Windows OS Users

**Though the Bilobe executable file is released simultaneously with the build release, you want be able to use Bilobe throughout your Windows machine, unless u dont add the .exe file to the system path. A wave to tackle this until an installer release of Bilobe is made for Windows, you can use the Windows Sub-System For Linux(WSL or WSL2), with which u can do all the setup that can be done on UNIX-Based Systems.**

## Usage

_Once the building and installation of Bilobe is done, you can follow the below instruction according to your OS:_

    1. On UNIX-Based Systems you can start it from your terminal by the command `bilobe`
    2. On Windows OS, u can start it by just running the .exe file that you have downloaded
